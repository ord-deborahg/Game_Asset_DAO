# Game Asset DAO: A Player-Owned NFT Factory 🛠️🎮

Game Asset DAO is a revolutionary platform that empowers players to collectively own and govern an NFT asset factory, leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to ensure secure, transparent decision-making. Through encrypted voting, members of this decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) determine the types of game assets created, fostering true player-driven content creation.

## Problem Statement: The Challenge of Game Asset Ownership 🎭

In traditional gaming environments, players often invest significant time and money into acquiring game assets that they do not truly own. The lack of transparency and control can lead to dissatisfaction and disengagement. Furthermore, the process of deciding what assets to create often lies in the hands of corporate entities, leaving players out of the creative loop. 

## The FHE Solution: A New Era of Governance 🔒

**Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology provides a groundbreaking solution to these challenges. By implementing FHE through Zama's open-source libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, Game Asset DAO allows players to vote on asset creation without compromising their privacy or the integrity of the voting process. This ensures that all decisions are made fairly and securely, with the capability to guarantee random asset rarity. Players not only get to influence the type of game assets being produced but also reap rewards from profits generated by the factory.

## Core Features 🌟

- **Democratic Asset Production:** DAO members vote to decide on the types of NFTs to create, ensuring community representation in the production process.
- **Fair Rarity Distribution:** The rarity attributes of each NFT are generated in a fair and transparent manner using Zama's FHE.
- **Profit Sharing:** Earnings from sold NFTs are distributed among DAO members in a transparent way, promoting a true player-owned economy.
- **Factory Management Dashboard:** An intuitive interface that allows members to propose ideas, vote, and manage the asset factory operations seamlessly.

## Technology Stack 🔧

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The cornerstone of confidential computing, enabling secure decision-making and privacy.
- **Solidity:** The programming language for smart contract development on Ethereum.
- **Hardhat:** A development environment for compiling and testing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side, useful for backend operations.

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install project dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Important:** Do not use `git clone` or any repository URLs to set up this project.

## Build & Run Guide 🏗️

Once the project is set up, you can compile, test, and run the Game Asset DAO using the following commands:

- **Compile Smart Contracts:**
  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

- **Run Tests:**
  
  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```

- **Deploy to Network:**

   To deploy the smart contracts to your chosen Ethereum network, execute:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetworkName
   ```

## Example Code Snippet 📜

Here's an example of how you might structure the vote function in your smart contract, ensuring that all votes are cast using encrypted values for security:

```solidity
// Game_Asset_DAO.sol

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Game_Asset_DAO {
    mapping(address => bytes32) public encryptedVotes;

    function vote(bytes32 encryptedVote) public {
        encryptedVotes[msg.sender] = encryptedVote;
    }

    function revealVote() public view returns (bytes32) {
        return encryptedVotes[msg.sender];
    }
}
```

This simple contract snippet illustrates how encrypted votes are stored and can later be revealed without compromising participant privacy.
